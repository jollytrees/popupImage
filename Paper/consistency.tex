\subsection{Consistency}
As we design the popup craft based on the input image, we want the design result to follow the input shape. Some geometry changes are avoidable since we need to add fold lines between patches, but still we want to minimize the geometry change. Although more complicated metric could be applied here, we use a simple metric to measure the geometry change. That is, the geometry change for a fold line is the amount of shift from its initial location to its final location, and the geometry change for the design result is the summation of fold line geometry changes. So the consistency is measured as: -$\lambda_{pos}\sum_f(pos(f) - pos_i(f))^2$.
