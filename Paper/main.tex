\begin{abstract}

  In this project, we focus on automatic popup craft design with the problem setting from \cite{liu2014image}. But instead of using the greedy method used in \cite{liu2014image}, we use non-linear optimization to optimize the design globally. The optimization formulation is designed such that an optimal solution is a popup design which 1) follows the input shape, 2) is foldable, and 3) is connected, and 4) is stable (See Section \ref{introduction}).
