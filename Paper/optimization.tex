\section{Optimization}
Based on popup graphs, we only need three sets of key variables to define a popup craft design:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $a(f)$: A binary variable indicating the activeness of fold line $f$.
\item $c(f)$: A binary variable indicating the convexity of fold line $f$ (whether the fold line points outwards ($c(f) = 1$) or inwards ($c(f) = 0$).
\item $p(f)$: A integer variable indicating the position of fold line $f$.
\end{enumerate}

The goal is to determine these variables so that the popup graph satisfies four key properties: foldability, connectivity, stability and consistency. Additional properties can be enforced according to user input. We will explain each property and show how to formulate such property in our optimization framework.
