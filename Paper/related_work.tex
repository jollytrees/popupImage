\section{Related Work}

Due to rigid paper crafting constraints, the OA design process is often time consum- ing and requires considerable skills. Several computer-aided design tools have been developed to provide a virtual design environment and assist the design process (see \cite{mitani2004computer} and the references therein). However, the ultimate placement of cuts and folds still depends on the user, posing the design process trouble- some and highly skill-demanding. To further simplify OA design, Li et al.~\cite{li2010popup} proposed a fully automatic algorithm to convert building models to paper architectures. Le et al.\cite{le2014surface} presented a surface-and-contour-preserving method to pop up 3D models with more freeform shapes. Liu et al.\cite{liu2014image} proposes an image-based approach but the greedy approach fails in many cases.
